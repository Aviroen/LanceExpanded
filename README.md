Hey, if you're here by some strange reason, you're probably wondering what happened to this mod.

Short answer: I no longer wish to upkeep this mod due to personal circumstance.

There is no long answer.

While anyone is free to pick up the Content Patcher / writing of this mod, I don't plan to help in upkeep.

If there are previous versions that have the [Assets] folder but you wish to republish, you will need to either commission the art / maps or redo them yourself.

Only what is here in this repository is under MIT. If there are any art assets on republished sites like Nexus / ModDrop / Etc, then they are not permissable by All Rights Reserved.

Cheers for the almost year!
