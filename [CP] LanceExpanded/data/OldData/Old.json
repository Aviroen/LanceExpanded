 "Married.GiftReaction_Dewdrop_Berry": "The product of your nexus?#$b#It's quite fascinating that something like this can grow out of your grove.#$b#Is it possibly a byproduct of your inherent magic? I wonder if it can be distilled--#$e#%Lance is pondering.#$b#I apologize, my love, I'll hand it back to you--#$b#Oh, was it for me?#$b#Thank you, my love, I will take care to bring back the results of my research for you.",

 "Married.GiftReaction_Gemfish": "Ahem*#$b#I did contemplate at one time whether these were actually edible, but Edmund had already told me that they were in fact, not.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Goldenfish": "Oh--Have you been interested in the Sprite Spring?#$b#Magnus enjoys the boons from being inclined with the actual sprites there, they don't quite see eye-to-eye with me, however.#$b#They don't quite like how my magic tastes, apparently.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Monster_Fruit": "Another monster fruit, my love?#$b#Thanks to your efforts, I've been able to dive further into my research of these.#$e#You'd like to know of them?#$b#Well--the monster fruit has such a tenacious appearance due to the fact that it's nectar is quite sweet.#$b#We have an aversion to eating things with an appearance close to our own, but Edmund, the ever curious, said it tasted like one of the sweetest fruits he's ever had.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Void_Eel": "Where did you get this kind of eel, my love? The witch swamp...? Interesting, I guess the corruption of her magic has spread to the outerlying area. I will have to report this to Magnus, thank you, my love.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Void_Eel2": "Thank you again for the void eel, my love.#$b#Magnus wasn't too happy about the resurgence of his perpetual duty, but it's better than a rampant witch on the loose.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Torpedo_Trout": "There's a researcher that's attempting to entertain the idea of using these fish as a mode of transportation.#$b#Unfortunately they have no semblance of being able to be trained.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Lunaloo": "Were you interested in the fact that lunaloos don't follow strobilation?#$b#The magic of the valley is what is theorized in why they choose this location for migration.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Shiny_Lunaloo": "Continuing the aquatic lesson, are we?#$b#Shiny lunaloos are the most matured form as well as the form they take for their migration.#$b#The main theory behind their bioluminescence is to threaten, their venom isn't toxic to us, but it's helpful in their hunts.#$b#The other theory is that they use their bioluminescence to blind predators.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Radioactive_Bass": "A mutation from the sewers?",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Radioactive_Bass2": "I hope this doesn't affect Krobus.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Slime_Berry": "The slime berry!#$b#We've finally figured out we can use it for explosives if necessary.#$b#It's useful for sticking things together, but it's not advised on open wounds.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Void_Root": "Thank you, my love, the research is going quite well on these crops.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Void_Root2": "For my trips to Krobus?#$b#I haven't been able to make a dish with this as it tends to... become extremely volatile when handled.#$b#Thankfully Krobus doesn't seem to mind and eats them as is, thank you, my love.",

 "Married.GiftReaction_Void_Delight2": "You learned this from Krobus?#$b#Maybe that's what I can feed to Krobus...#$e#%Lance is contemplating.",
 "Married.GiftReaction_Void_Salmon_Sushi": "Ah, another void dish, my love?#$b#I'm not well versed in the void energies like Magnus so you'll have to excuse me for not actually eating these.",

 //Perigee was famously stubborn and durable. She didn't fight on the front lines, but rather defended those towards the back. Also loved to sleep, loved to eat. Her epithet was "The Bear of Belgara", though her friends jokingly called her "Mama Bear". Her favored weapon was a shillelagh, which she could use to clobber enemies or cast spells.
 //"Funnily enough Mary never had a taste for violence, but she certainly had the stomach for seeing it. She was often the first name on everyone's lips when healing was needed due to her vast knowledge of various natural and synthetic remedies. Though very focused when it came to her work, outside of the medical tent Mary found joy in relaxing under trees and was often found asleep under them with her journal. She had a quarterstaff on her at almost all times that would focus her healing magic, and was known to give rambunctious soldiers quite the bump on the head should they get out of line."
