   magnus chastizes lance about not watering his research plant and it has ended up withered
   lance disgruntled, kicks around dirt
   farmer shows up
   embarassed, lance runs into the wizard's house to hide
   wizard laughs about how his 'son' has many achievements but only a few flaws
   f-"are you proud of him?"
   m-'very, give me some time and i'll invite you in'
   time passes, farmer checks on the plant themselves
   it's not really withered, it can be redeemed
   sneakily cuts the rotten leaves and sprays with fertilizer/water
   wizard comes back out, sees how it has renewed its magic
   m-'interesting, interesting! lance! look!'
   lance begrudgingly comes outside to see that the plant has a renewed vigor
   m-'from the ashes, like that legendary bird'
   l--i can't thank you enough for covering for my mistake...-
   "it's no problem / you didn't really kill it / are you really that bad with plants?"
   1/ it's amazing, you must have some kind of magic
   2/ i... didn't? but usually all the plants i cater to end up cindered...
   3/ every plant i've ever touched if it isn't about cooking has become cinders...
   -we should take lessons together, i could learn something from someone who doesn't blow hard and gets red in the face-

    m-'ah, you've made it, come, come, these tests shouldn't be painful but i'm not exactly a mundane'
    "that sounds terrifying"
    magnus laughs
    m-surely you'll be fine, what with your vitality and hearty nature
    l-mag, don't scare /name/ too badly, you wanted to know if they had magic in the first place didn't you
    m-yes, yes, i'd like to know the effects if it was /name/ or just the lands themselves that gives that farm the vitality that it has
    farmer ???
    m-well, it might be normal to you, but the farmland you call home has an abnormally high saturation of magic
    m-so much so, that if it weren't for your grandfather, i'd have those lands under my study
    m-but i'm not an old petty man
    l-whispering/yeah sure you aren't
    m-boy, you haven't seen petty
    m-nevertheless, let's get on with these tests, shall we?
    oh boy potions
    oh boy tests
    oh boy pain of scripting this
    m-hmm, while i can't conduct any conclusive evidence as it is right now, you might have an inkling to it
    farmer !!!
    m-but don't put all of your eggs in this basket just yet, we'll know in a few days time
    m-i'll have lance fetch you again once the ministry returns with the results
    l-for now, are we done, mag?
    m-yes, yes, my impatient son, we are done
    l-good! /name/ i've got something to show you if you don't mind
    lance holds out his hand
    farmer takes it
    l-right this way, right this way
    -warps
    fancy shmancy wibbly warbly area, maybe a glimpse of morabyr
    l-that portal was showing these lands, the people there are quite distinctive from this little abode, aren't they?
    l-the ministry is currently looking for scouts, and i've contacted a few people to check
    l-i'm bound by this place for quite awhile, but they'll be able to give me updates
    f-seems like you're excited
    l-ex--well, yes. i guess! (smiles) new lands, new magics, new people! it's one of the most invigorating feelings arou-
    suddenly lance drops to his knee
    farmer ???
    l-i... might've gotten a little too excited... haha... old... old scars.
    l-pardon
    lance gets up, shakily
    l-thanks, usually it doesn't flare up like this but i guess... memories 
    l-sorry, sorry to cut this fun time short
    l-is it alright if i head out first?
    farmer nod/acceptance/yeah
    l-thank you, hopefully we'll see some good results in a few days
    l-take care, /name/

    lance's side job is ensuring the lanterns are affixed with monster-repellant magic
    -it's not much of a job, just something to keep the mind from wandering amidst the blazing sun-
    -if you don't mind, do you want the wander alongside me as i do this menial chore?-
    1 sure!/2 not right now/3 would you teach me magic?
    1/ your company is much appreciated, like respite from heavy downpour
    2/ oh, well that's alright, feel free to ask for me whenever you do have the time. i know the farm takes quite a lot of vigor
    3/ i'm not really a teacher, but i can ask magnus if you have the capability.
    1 & 3/obviously since my hair isn't as vibrant as magnus', i'm not his real child, adoptive son.
    stole me away from a battlefield while i was a magic soldier for an enemy.
    can you guess just how old magnus really is?
    1 like, hundreds?/2 like, thousands?
    1a hundreds is close, but not quite/2a not a numerous amount of thousands but he's hit his millennium a few decades ago
    1b try a millennia/2b he doesn't like me talking about his age though
    "so then, how old are /you/?"
    *laugh*
    not anywhere close but i've still outpaced a normal human lifespan.
    maybe around 150? 180?
    "you forgot?"
    time tends to slip away from you if you don't keep on your toes, and we're not exactly fighting for a war with everything at stake anymore

    finally reaching the last lamppost
    thanks for coming along with me, it really made time fly, hopefully we'll... see each other again?

    m-well if it isn't the hellion himself
    l-we both know i haven't been called that in years
    g-that doesn't mean you can escape the nick, kid
    l-how much longer will i be a 'kid' to you?
    m/g laugh
    m/g probably when you finally figure out how to settle down
    lance grumbles
    what does it matter if i've settled down or not?
    m-y'see, kid, no matter how many years you've got on me, you still have that spark of bewilderment when it comes to relationships
    l-you're saying that /you/ have more experience?
    g-folks used to call him the 'marvelous marlon'
    m-ah we're going back to those stories
    l-if we're talking of our love life, i've surely had more than my fair share of tastes
    m/g-he doesn't get it
    m/g laugh
    lance grumbles again
    m-look, kid, someday, someone will just grasp your soul and it'll feel like everything else prior was pointless
    l-that sounds hellish
    m-oh, it is
    farmer enters
    m-well hello, our adventurer of the hour, we've just been beating the bush with lance here
    g-kid doesn't know what'll hit him
    m/g laugh
    farmer ???
    l-don't... don't worry about them, shall we?
    go outside
    magnus said he'll check your aptitude in a few days, it'll be a few tests and he'll get back to you after the results come back
    !!!
    *chuckle* i'll be sure to pick you up from your farm when he's got all the instruments ready
    walk around to the fountain in town
    "so why have you come around to pelican town?"
    oh? a pointed question
    hmm
    i'd have to say it's because work has finally slowed down in the capital for me
    "capital?"
    ah, mages, wizards, witches, we have our own regions for commerce and legislation
    it's very boring, and while you wouldn't exactly have to deal with it... if you actually have magic, then if you want to work you'll have to register with the ministry
    there have been some stories upon the wind that they might need mages for new lands
    "new lands?"
    *chuckle*
    i don't have the exact details, but there's whispers of an unstable portal that's opened up around this area
    technically, i've been reassigned here to ensure that the portal doesn't cause harm to the populace
    but it was also nice to just be around my father again
    a few colleagues are already setting up around the portal. unfortunately i can't get you to greet them just yet.
    maybe if you have aptitude?

    it was nice, again, to speak like this with you
    just, just don't mind what marlon and gil were saying, would you?
    1 maybe/2 i don't know what they said
    1a *blush* er, hah... haha, for my sake?/2a that's... good... that's good
